**Design, develop, and deploy highly adaptable, scalable, and secure RESTful web APIs**

## What is this book about?
This book deals with the Representational State Transfer (REST) paradigm, which is an architectural style that allows networked devices to communicate with each other over the internet. With the help of this book, you’ll explore the concepts of service-oriented architecture (SOA), event-driven architecture (EDA), and resource-oriented architecture (ROA). This book covers why there is an insistence for high-quality APIs toward enterprise integration.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore RESTful concepts, including URI, HATEOAS, and Code on Demand 
* Study core patterns like Statelessness, Pagination, and Discoverability 
* Optimize endpoints for linked microservices with API gateways 
* Delve into API authentication, authorization, and API security implementations 
* Work with Service Orchestration to craft composite and process-aware services 
* Expose RESTful protocol-based APIs for cloud computing

    {
       return investorService.fetchAllInvestors();
    }
```
